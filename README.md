# Data Structures and Algorithms questions

This repository contains practice questions for DSA Interview Preparation. It is an ongoing process for me so I would be uploading more questions and solutions with time  
  
I would be using
* Python
* C++
* C

for implementing the programs however the main focus is to solve the problem rather focussing on the language. 
  
Each question is represented by a folder. In each folder their are two files:
* desc: contains the question and an example of output
* sol: contains the solution for the corresponding question
