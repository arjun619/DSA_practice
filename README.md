# Data Structures and Algorithms questions

This repository contains practice questions for DSA Interview Preparation. It is an ongoing process for me so I would be uploading more questions and solutions with time  
  
I would be using
* Python
* C++
* C

for implementing the programs however the main focus is to solve the problem rather focussing on the language.
