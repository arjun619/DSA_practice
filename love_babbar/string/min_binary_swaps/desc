Given a binary string, that is it contains only 0s and 1s. We need to make this string a sequence of alternate characters by flipping some of the bits, our goal is to minimize the number of bits to be flipped.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "001"
Output: 1
Explanation: We can flip the 0th bit to 1
to have "101".
