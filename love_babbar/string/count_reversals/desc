Given a string S consisting of only opening and closing curly brackets '{' and '}', find out the minimum number of reversals required to convert the string into a balanced expression.
A reversal means changing '{' to '}' or vice-versa.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "}{{}}{{{"
Output: 3
Explanation: One way to balance is:
"{{{}}{}}". There is no balanced sequence
that can be formed in lesser reversals.
