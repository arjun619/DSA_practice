Given two arrays: a1[0..n-1] of size n and a2[0..m-1] of size m. Task is to check whether a2[] is a subset of a1[] or not. Both the arrays can be sorted or unsorted. It may be assumed that elements in both array are distinct.
 

Example 1:

Input:
a1[] = {11, 1, 13, 21, 3, 7}
a2[] = {11, 3, 7, 1}
Output:
